# LLOGIN: Auto Login Script for LPU Network

A simple bash script to automate the login process for LPU Network.

## Usage
```bash
./main.sh <username> <password>
```

You can also create an alias for the script in your `.bashrc` or other terminal `.config` file to make it even simpler.

```bash
alias llogin="bash ~/path/to/main.sh <username> <password>"
```

Now you just have to type `llogin` in your terminal to login to the network.
